# Welcome to TJ's Blog App

Thanks for checking it out. This was my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. The blog was actually designed for generic development for customization for specific purposes. I updated this from a previous version that I had developed in EJS. The new version was created in React with a Node backend. It also uses Passport which allows for an admin page where the admin can manipulate his/her posts however they see fit. It also is styled and structured on the front-end with Bootstrap.
